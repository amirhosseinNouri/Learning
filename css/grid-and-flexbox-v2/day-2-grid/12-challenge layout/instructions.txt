12-challenge layout INSTRUCTIONS

There are two challenges to tackle, depending on your time.



12A - MOSAIC GRID LAYOUT

In the begin folder, you're given some starting HTML and CSS.

Using CSS Grid, lay out the page as you see in the screenshots for desktop and mobile dimensions.

HINTS:
- You may want to steal some styling from the Flexbox layouts we did yesterday with similar content.

- You may want to consider looking at some of the other work we've done today and apply it to this problem.

- Start with the number of rows and columns needed, then worry about how to fit the images into those spaces.





12B - INTEGRATE INTO THE HOME PAGE

I've given you yesterday's final end state of our Flexbox work.

Now try swapping out the "collections" section at the bottom of the home page for the "pop art" mosaic you just created with Grid.
