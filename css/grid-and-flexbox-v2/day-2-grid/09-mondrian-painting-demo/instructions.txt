9-mondrian-painting-demo Instructions

Jen will walk through an interactive demo in which you'll reconstruct a painting by Piet Mondrian in CSS Grid. Copy the painting as closely as possible, given what you know about CSS Grid.

Note: You will not be 100% perfect -- the painting isn't 100% perfect! But you will be very close.

Grid will always try to lay out information from the upper left to the lower right (at least in left-to-right systems), with each grid item occupying one row and one column.

If you want to override that distribution, you must provide directions. 

In example 9A, we have called out the location of each element, row and column.

In 9B, we reduce the number of declarations, using Grid's tendency to place most of our grid items correctly, and using our declarations to override only what's needed.
