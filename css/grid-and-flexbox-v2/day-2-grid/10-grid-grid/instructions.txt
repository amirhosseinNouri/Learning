Next, we'll create a 4-column grid system.  

Same instructions as before -- the HTML will tell you how many boxes per row. There should be 4 columns, just as we did with Flexbox.

However, this time, you should not need to mark each row individually. Because this is Grid, you should have enough markup here to set this up without adding extra divs.

You may need to add some classes to designate how large each box should be. Consider what your default value is - those boxes may not need a class.


PART 10B: RESPONSIVE SYSTEM
Now we'll add media queries to make our grid system mobile-first.
