# Buffered Channels

Channels can *optionally* be buffered.

## Creating a channel with a buffer

You can provide a buffer length as the second argument to `make()` to create a buffered channel:

```go
ch := make(chan int, 100)
```

Sending on a buffered channel only blocks when the buffer is *full*. 

Receiving blocks only when the buffer is *empty*.

## Assignment

We want to be able to send emails in *batches*. A *writing* goroutine will write an entire batch of email messages to a buffered channel, and later, once the channel is full, a *reading* goroutine will read all of the messages from the channel and send them out to our clients.

Complete the `addEmailsToQueue` function. It should create a buffered channel with a buffer large enough to store all of the `emails` it's given. It should then write the emails to the channelÂ in order, and finally return the channel.
