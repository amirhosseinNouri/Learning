# Go is fast, simple and productive

Generally speaking, compiled languages run much faster than interpreted languages, and Go is no exception.

Go is one of the fastest programming languages, beating JavaScript, Python, and Ruby handily in most benchmarks.

However, Go code doesn't *run* quite as fast as its compiled Rust and C counterparts. That said, it *compiles* much faster than they do, which makes the developer experience super productive. Unfortunately, there are no swordfights on Go teams...
