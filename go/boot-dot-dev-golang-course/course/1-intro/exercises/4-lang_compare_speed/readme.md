# Comparing Go's Speed

Go is *generally* faster and more lightweight than interpreted or VM-powered languages like:

* Python
* JavaScript
* PHP
* Ruby
* Java

However, in terms of execution speed, Go does lag behind some other compiled languages like:

* C
* C++
* Rust

Go is a bit slower mostly due to its automated memory management, also known as the "Go runtime". Slightly slower speed is the price we pay for memory safety and simple syntax!

Textio is an amazing candidate for a Go project. We'll be able to quickly process large amounts of text all while using a language that is safe and simple to write.
