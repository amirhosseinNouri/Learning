# Parametric Constraints

Your interface definitions, which can later be used as constraints, can accept type parameters as well.

```go
// The store interface represents a store that sells products.
// It takes a type parameter P that represents the type of products the store sells.
type store[P product] interface {
	Sell(P)
}

type product interface {
	Price() float64
	Name() string
}

type book struct {
	title  string
	author string
	price  float64
}

func (b book) Price() float64 {
	return b.price
}

func (b book) Name() string {
	return fmt.Sprintf("%s by %s", b.title, b.author)
}

type toy struct {
	name  string
	price float64
}

func (t toy) Price() float64 {
	return t.price
}

func (t toy) Name() string {
	return t.name
}

// The bookStore struct represents a store that sells books.
type bookStore struct {
	booksSold []book
}

// Sell adds a book to the bookStore's inventory.
func (bs *bookStore) Sell(b book) {
	bs.booksSold = append(bs.booksSold, b)
}

// The toyStore struct represents a store that sells toys.
type toyStore struct {
	toysSold []toy
}

// Sell adds a toy to the toyStore's inventory.
func (ts *toyStore) Sell(t toy) {
	ts.toysSold = append(ts.toysSold, t)
}

// sellProducts takes a store and a slice of products and sells
// each product one by one.
func sellProducts[P product](s store[P], products []P) {
	for _, p := range products {
		s.Sell(p)
	}
}

func main() {
	bs := bookStore{
		booksSold: []book{},
	}
    
    // By passing in "book" as a type parameter, we can use the sellProducts function to sell books in a bookStore
	sellProducts[book](&bs, []book{
		{
			title:  "The Hobbit",
			author: "J.R.R. Tolkien",
			price:  10.0,
		},
		{
			title:  "The Lord of the Rings",
			author: "J.R.R. Tolkien",
			price:  20.0,
		},
	})
	fmt.Println(bs.booksSold)

    // We can then do the same for toys
	ts := toyStore{
		toysSold: []toy{},
	}
	sellProducts[toy](&ts, []toy{
		{
			name:  "Lego",
			price: 10.0,
		},
		{
			name:  "Barbie",
			price: 20.0,
		},
	})
	fmt.Println(ts.toysSold)
}
```

## Assignment

The chief architect at Mailio has decided she wants to implement billing with generics. Specifically, she wants us to create a new `biller` interface. A `biller` is an interface that can be used to charge a `customer`, and it can also report its `name`.

There are two kinds of billers:

* `userBiller` (cheaper)
* `orgBiller` (more expensive)

A `customer` is either a `user` or an `org`. A `user` will be billed with a `userBiller` and an `org` with an `orgBiller`.

Create the new `biller` interface. It should have 2 methods:

* `Charge`
* `Name`

The good news is that the architect already wrote the `userBiller` and `orgBiller` types for us that fulfill this new `biller` interface. Use the definitions of those types and their methods to figure out how to write the `biller` interface definition starting on line 7.
