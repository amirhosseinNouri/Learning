# The Benefits of Named Returns

## Good For Documentation (Understanding)

Named return parameters are great for documenting a function. We know what the function is returning directly from its signature, no need for a comment.

Named return parameters are particularly important in longer functions with many return values.

```go
func calculator(a, b int) (mul, div int, err error) {
    if b == 0 {
      return 0, 0, errors.New("Can't divide by zero")
    }
    mul = a * b
    div = a / b
    return mul, div, nil
}
```

Which is easier to understand than:

```go
func calculator(a, b int) (int, int, error) {
    if b == 0 {
      return 0, 0, errors.New("Can't divide by zero")
    }
    mul := a * b
    div := a / b
    return mul, div, nil
}
```

We know *the meaning* of each return value just by looking at the function signature: `func calculator(a, b int) (mul, div int, err error)`

## Less Code (Sometimes)

If there are multiple return statements in a function, you donâ€™t need to write all the return values each time, though you *probably* should.

When you choose to omit return values, it's called a *naked* return. Naked returns should only be used in short and simple functions.
