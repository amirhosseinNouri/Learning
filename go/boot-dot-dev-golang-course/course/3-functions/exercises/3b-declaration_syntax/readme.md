# Declaration Syntax

Developers often wonder why the declaration syntax in Go is different from the tradition established in the C family of languages.

## C-Style syntax

The C language describes types with an expression including the name to be declared, and states what type that expression will have.

```c
int y;
```

The code above declares `y` as an `int`. In general, the type goes on the left and the expression on the right.

Interestingly, the creators of the Go language agreed that the C-style of declaring types in signatures gets confusing really fast - take a look at this nightmare.

```c
int (*fp)(int (*ff)(int x, int y), int b)
```

## Go-style syntax

Go's declarations are clear, you just read them left to right, just like you would in English.

```go
x int
p *int
a [3]int
```

It's nice for more complex signatures, it makes them easier to read.

```go
f func(func(int,int) int, int) int
```
