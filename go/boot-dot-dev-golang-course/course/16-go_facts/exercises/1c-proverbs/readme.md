# Go Proverbs

Similar to the [Zen of Python](https://peps.python.org/pep-0020/) that we covered in the "Learn Python" course, the [Go Proverbs](https://go-proverbs.github.io/) are a beautiful collection of wise words from Rob Pike, one of Go's creators.

> Don't communicate by sharing memory, share memory by communicating.
> 
> Concurrency is not parallelism.
> 
> Channels orchestrate; mutexes serialize.
> 
> The bigger the interface, the weaker the abstraction.
> 
> Make the zero value useful.
> 
> interface{} says nothing.
>
> Gofmt's style is no one's favorite, yet gofmt is everyone's favorite.
> 
> A little copying is better than a little dependency.
> 
> Syscall must always be guarded with build tags.
> 
> Cgo must always be guarded with build tags.
>
> Cgo is not Go.
>
> With the unsafe package there are no guarantees.
>
> Clear is better than clever.
>
> Reflection is never clear.
>
> Errors are values.
>
> Don't just check errors, handle them gracefully.
>
> Design the architecture, name the components, document the details.
>
> Documentation is for users.
>
> Don't panic.
