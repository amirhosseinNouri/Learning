# Fizzbuzz

Go supports the standard [modulo operator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modulo_operation):

```go
7 % 3 // 1
```

Logical [AND operator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Logical_AND):

```go
true && false // false
true && true // true
```

Logical [OR operator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Logical_OR):

```go
true || false // true
false || false // false
```

## Assignment

We're hiring engineers at Textio, so time to brush up on the classic "Fizzbuzz" game, a coding exercise that has been dramatically overused in coding interviews across the world.

Complete the `fizzbuzz` function that prints the numbers 1 to 100 inclusive each on their own line, but substitutes multiples of 3 for the text `fizz` and multiples of 5 for `buzz`. For multiples of 3 AND 5 print instead `fizzbuzz`.
