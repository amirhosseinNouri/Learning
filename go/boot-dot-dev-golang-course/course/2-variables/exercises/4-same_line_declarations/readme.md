# Same Line Declarations

We are able to declare multiple variables on the same line:

```go
mileage, company := 80276, "Tesla"

// is the same as

mileage := 80276
company := "Tesla"
```
## Assignment

Within the main function, declare a float called `averageOpenRate` and string called `displayMessage` on the same line.

Initialize them to values of `.23` and `is the average open rate of your messages` respectively before they are printed.
