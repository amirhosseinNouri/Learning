## Ideas for extending the project

You don't *have* to extend this project, but here are just a few ideas if you're interested:

* Support [pagination](https://nordicapis.com/everything-you-need-to-know-about-api-pagination/) of the endpoints that can return many items
* Support different options for sorting and filtering posts using query parameters
* Classify different types of feeds and posts (e.g. blog, podcast, video, etc.)
* Add a CLI client that uses the API to fetch and display posts, maybe it even allows you to read them in your terminal
* Scrape lists of feeds themselves from a third-party site that aggregates feed URLs
* Add support for other types of feeds (e.g. Atom, JSON, etc.)
* Add integration tests that use the API to create, read, update, and delete feeds and posts
* Add bookmarking or "liking" to posts
* Create a simple web UI that uses your backend API
