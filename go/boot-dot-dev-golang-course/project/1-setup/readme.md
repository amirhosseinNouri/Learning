# Welcome

## What are we building?

We're going to build an [RSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS) feed aggregator in Go! It's a web server that allows clients to:

* Add RSS feeds to be collected
* Follow and unfollow RSS feeds that other users have added
* Fetch all of the latest posts from the RSS feeds they follow

RSS feeds are a way for websites to publish updates to their content. You can use this project to keep up with your favorite blogs, news sites, podcasts, and more!

## Prerequisites

This project assumes that you've already taken our "Learn Web Servers" course. If you haven't, go take it! It will give you a solid foundation for this project.

## Learning goals

* Learn how to integrate a Go server with PostgreSQL
* Learn about the basics of database migrations
* Learn about long-running service workers

## Setup

Before we dive into the project, let's make sure you have everything you'll need on your machine.

1. An editor. I use [VS code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), you can use whatever you like.
2. A command line. I work on Mac OS/Linux, so instructions will be in Bash. I recommend [WSL 2](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) if you're on Windows so you can still use Linux commands.
3. The latest [Go toolchain](https://golang.org/doc/install).
4. If you're in VS Code, I recommend the official [Go extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=golang.Go).
5. An HTTP client. I use [Thunder Client](https://www.thunderclient.io/), but you can use whatever you like.

If you're ready, move on to the next step!
