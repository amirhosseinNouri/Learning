What use cases can you think of for HOC's that aren't related to React?

Do you have any experience with using libraries that use the 'as' props? What was your experience like?

What are some alternative API's you could use instead of the 'as' prop? (Radix's 'asChild' is an extremely smart workaround for this.)

Are render props and HOC's even useful now we have hooks? What are some use cases for them?
