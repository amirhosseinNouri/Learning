Why doesn't this code work without the comma (in a .tsx file)?

```tsx

What problems have you solved with generics that aren't related to React?

What libraries can you think of that rely on generics to do their magic?

What use cases have you seen for `React.ComponentType` and `React.ComponentProps`?
