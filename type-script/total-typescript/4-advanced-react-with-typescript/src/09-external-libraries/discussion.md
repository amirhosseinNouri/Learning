Which other libraries have you used with React? What was your experience like creating wrappers for them?

What are some other libraries you can think of that could benefit from a wrapper?

Try installing a third-party library that you love, and explore some of its types. Try to choose one you all know. Write down some of the things you notice - and how the types could be improved.

Some libraries to try:

- zod
- radix
- @material/ui
- react-router
- react-final-form
- react-table
- react-spring
- framer-motion
