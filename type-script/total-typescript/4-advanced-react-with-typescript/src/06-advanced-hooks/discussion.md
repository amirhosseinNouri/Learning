What use cases have you seen for function overloads that aren't related to React?

How are function overloads different to generics? Which are safer? Which are more flexible?

Which do you prefer - discriminated tuples or discriminated unions of objects? Why?

Have you used 'as const' before? If so, what was your use case?
