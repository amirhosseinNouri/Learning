## Quickstart

Clone this repo or [open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/total-typescript/advanced-patterns-workshop).

```sh
# Installs all dependencies
npm install

# Starts the first exercise
npm run exercise 01

# Runs linting and tests on the solution
npm run solution 01
```

## How to take the course

You'll notice that the course is split into modules. Each module is a group of related exercises.

Each exercise is split into a `*.problem.ts` and a `*.solution.ts`.

To take an exercise:

1. Go into `*.problem.ts`
2. Run `npm run exercise 01`, where `01` is the number of the exercise (not module) you're on.

The `exercise` script will run TypeScript typechecks and a test suite on the exercise.

This course encourages **active, exploratory learning**. I'll present a problem, and **you'll be asked to try to find a solution**. To attempt a solution, you'll need to:

1. Check out [TypeScript's docs](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/intro.html)
2. Try to find something that looks relevant.
3. Give it a go to see if it solves the problem.

You'll know if you've succeeded because the tests will pass.

**If you succeed**, or **if you get stuck**, unpause the video and check out the `*.solution.ts`. You can see if your solution is better or worse than mine!

You can run `npm run solution 01` to run the tests and typechecking on the solution.
